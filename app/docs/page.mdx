## Importing from Lichess
To import a chess game directly from lichess, navigate to the Analysis tab and select Lichess.org as an import method. A new drop-down should appear allowing you to search for a specific lichess account. Selecing an account will display a list of games played by that account in the selected time span (last few days by default). You can also search for a game that happened at a slecific time using the calendar that pops up when clicking the time span.
